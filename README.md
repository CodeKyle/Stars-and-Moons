Stars and Moons is a simple tic-tac-toe clone with a space-themed twist. Two human players are required, as a computer opponent has not been implemented. Player 1 uses the symbol of the pale crescent moon, while player 2 uses the symbol of the golden star. Which of the two will dominate the galaxy? Well, ...that is up to you. Good luck!
